# Playable Piano with Circle of Fifths Tutorial Mode
This is a playable browser-based 24-key Piano that includes tutorials on how to play the major chords in the Circle of Fifths.

The tutorial button for each major chord will highlight the keys that make up the chord, and there is a reset button to return all of the keys to normal.
This piano is best played in a desktop-sized browser window and was created using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to control the audio, the highlighted states of the keys, and more.

The original concept of the piano is based on a tutorial from WebDevSimplified. After doubling the amount of available piano keys compared to the original project, I implemented the Circle of Fifths elements into this version by writing **custom JavaScript functions** to map highlighted keys to the different major chords and used **custom CSS styling with accessible color contrasting** for highlighting and labelling the keys with the corresponding notes. As I learn more about how to make the web accessible, I would like to make the Circle of Fifths tutorial mode feasibly playable with the assistance of a screen reader. I would also return to this project to make the layout responsive for playing this piano on a landscape-oriented mobile device.
