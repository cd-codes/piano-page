# piano-page
---
This a personal project that takes inspiration from Web Dev Simplified's project JavaScript Piano on YouTube.
For this project, I would like to expand on the original idea:
1. Double the amount of notes available to play
2. Add header text to the page
3. Incorporte modern styling elements on the page
4. Add a Circle of Fifths tutorial mode where a user can play through the circle of fifths
5. Allow the user to reset or switch the tutorial at any point
6. Add a footer with credits for the origianl project inspiration and the source for the note mp3 files

In the future, I would like to revisit this project to add a song tutorial. Challenges that I anticipate:
1. Using React to precisely manipulate the DOM
2. Toggling between Circle of Fifths mode and the song tutorial mode
