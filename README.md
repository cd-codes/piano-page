This project takes inspiration from Web Dev Simplified's JavaScript Piano on YouTube.
For this project, my goal is to expand on the original implementation:
1. *Double the amount of notes available to play*
2. *Add a header to the page*
3. *Add a Circle of Fifths tutorial mode where a user can play through the circle of fifths*
4. *Allow the user to reset or switch the tutorial at any point*
5. *Add a footer with credits for the original project inspiration and the source for the note mp3 files*
6. Incorporte modern styling elements on the page

In the future, I would like to expand this project to add a song tutorial mode. Challenges that I anticipate:
- Using React to precisely manipulate the DOM
- Toggling between Circle of Fifths mode and the song tutorial mode
