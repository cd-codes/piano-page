# Playable Piano with Circle of Fifths Tutorial Mode
[See this project live via GitHub Pages](https://cd-codes.github.io/piano-page/)

This is a playable browser-based 24-key Piano that includes tutorials on how to play the major chords in the Circle of Fifths.

- The tutorial button for each major chord highlights the keys that make up the chord.
- The reset button returns all of the keys to normal.
- Created using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to control the audio and the tutorial mode functionality.

The original concept of the piano is based on a tutorial from WebDevSimplified. After doubling the amount of available piano keys compared to the original tutorial, I implemented the Circle of Fifths elements into this version by writing **custom JavaScript functions** to map highlighted keys to the different major chords and used **custom CSS styling with accessible color contrasting** for highlighting and labelling the keys with the corresponding notes. 

Future possibilities for improvement:
- Making the Circle of Fifths tutorial mode more feasibly playable with the assistance of a screen reader.
- Updating the layout to be responsive for a landscape-oriented mobile device.
